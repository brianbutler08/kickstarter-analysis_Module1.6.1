# Module 1.6.1 Kickstater Analysis

## Background

For this project, we were approached by an up-and-coming playwright named Louise. She had written a new play titled *Fever* but needed to acquire the $10,000 of funding to get it produced. Louise had an interest in utilizing the online platform Kickstarter as a method to crowdfund her project and wanted to work with a data analyst proficient in Excel to explore some of the available Kickstarter data in order to maximize success. The general idea was that if we could identify some characteristics of successfully funded campaigns, we could perhaps apply that knowledge to Louise’s Kickstarter launch.!

We acquired a dataset (n=4,114) of various Kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2017, which included the following fields:
- Project name
- Project blurb
- Funding goal
- Amount pledged
- Outcome of campaign
- Country of origin
- Currency
- Date that the campaign opened
- Date that the campaign closed
- Number of backers
- If the campaign was a staff pick or highlighted
- Campaign category and subcategory

# Primary Findings

## Campaign Success Overview

Of the nine general categories of fundraising campaigns, the theater category had the most number of projects during this time period (1393), almost twice the number of the next most popular project (music – 700). When looking at only the US based projects, this trend continued, with 912 campaigns categorized as “theater”. Additionally, theater projects were the most successful during this time period, with 525 projects being successfully funded. And of those projects that were successful, 412 of them were plays, making “plays” the subcategory with the most successfully funded campaigns in the US.

## Timing Your Campaign Launch

When we looked at the timing of when campaigns were launched, it appears that there is a correlation between launch month and outcome. Overall, May was the most successful launch month for campaigns, with success rates gradually tapering downward over the summer.
